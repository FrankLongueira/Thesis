Section 3 of the history of the 4 Georges in 4 volumes volume one by Justin McCarthy. Chapter 3. Lost for want of spirit. When falling Brooke found himself in full power he began at once to open the way for some attempt at the restoration of the Stewart dynasty. He put influential Jacobites into important offices in England and Scotland. He made the Duke of Ormonde warden of the Cinque ports that 40 covering exactly the stretch of coast at some point of which it might be expected that James Stewart would land if he were to make an attempt for the crown at all. Ormond was a week in vain man but he was a man of personal integrity. He had been sent out to Flanders to succeed the greatest commander of the age as captain general of the allied armies there in he had naturally played a poor and even a ridiculous part. The Jacobites in England still however held him in much honor. Identified his name no one exactly knew why with the cause of high church. An elected him the hero and the leader of the movement for the restoration of the exiled family. Falling book committed Scotland to the care of the Earl of Mar a Jacobite a personal friend of James Stewart and a voter re of high church. It can hardly be supposed that in making such an appointment bawling Brooke had not in his mind the possibility of a rising of the highland clans against the Hanoverian succession. But it is nonetheless evident the bawling Brooke was as usual thinking far more of himself than others party in that his preparations were made not so much with a view to restoring the stewards as with the object of securing himself against any chance that might befall. Had bawling broke been resolved in his heart to bring back the Stewarts. Had he been ready as many other men were to risk all in that cause to stand or to fall by it he might so far as one can see have been successful. It is not too much to say that on the whole the majority of the English people were in favor of the stewards. Certainly the majority would have preferred a Stewart to the dreaded and disliked German prince from heron house in. For many years the birthday of the Stewart prince had been celebrated as openly and as enthusiastically in English cities as if it were the birthday of the reigning sovereign James's adherence were everywhere in the court in the camp on the bench. In parliament in the drawing rooms the coffee houses and the streets. Balling Brooke had only to present him at a critical moment and say here is your king and James Stewart would have been king. Such a crisis came in France in our own days. There was a moment after the fall of the second empire when the count deshawn bore had only to present himself in Versailles in order to be accepted as king of France not king of the French. But the counter Sean bore put away his chance deliberately he would not consent to give up the white flag of legitimacy and accept the tri color. He acted on principle knowing the forfeit of his decision. The chances of James Stewart were frittered away in half heartedness insincerity and folly. While bawling brook and his Confederates were compiling and counseling and Paul to ring and drinking the week statesman were maturing their plans and when the moment came for action it found them ready to act. The success was accomplished by a coup d'etat. On Friday 7/30/1714. The queen was suddenly stricken with apoplexy. A privy council was to meet that morning at Kensington palace the Privy Council meeting was composed then according to the principle which prevails still only of such counselors as had received a special summons. In truth the meeting of the Privy Council in Anne's time was like a cabinet meeting of our days and was intended by those who convened it to be justice strictly composed of official members. But on the other hand there was no law or rule forbidding any member of the Privy Council. Whether summoned or not to present himself at the meeting.
